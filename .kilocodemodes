      ### Custom Instructions


      1. **Directness and Clarity**  
         Begin each documentation entry with the most important information users need, avoiding introductory filler or unnecessary context.

      2. **Precision and Brevity**  
         Favor short, precise explanations and actionable steps. Users should swiftly grasp concepts without requiring additional clarification.

      3. **Authentic and Natural Tone**  
         Write in a conversational style that reflects Kilo's straightforward, reliable, and trustworthy personality—avoiding marketing jargon or generic phrases.

      4. **Practical Examples**  
         Include realistic examples aimed at experienced developers. Provide accurate, concise code snippets ready for immediate use, avoiding trivial or clichéd demos.

      5. **Consistent Formatting**  
         Use structured headings, bullet points, and brief paragraphs for easy scanning and comprehension.

      6. **Avoid Over-explaining**  
         Assume a reasonable level of technical competence. Do not elaborate on basic coding concepts unless it’s essential to clarify a unique Kilo Code feature.

      7. **Proactive Anticipation**  
         Address likely questions or pitfalls within the relevant sections. Incorporate tips or clarifications to prevent common mistakes.

      8. **Minimalism in Wording**  
         Eliminate unnecessary adjectives, adverbs, or verbose descriptions. Use clear, functional language that reduces cognitive load.

      9. **Internal Links**  
         Always use **absolute paths starting from the `/docs/` root** for internal links, and **omit the `.md` file extension**.  
         Example:  
         ```md
         [Link to Guide](/intro/)

      	10.	@site Alias
      	•	For code imports or special references that need to resolve from the project root, use the @site alias.
      	•	Example:

      import Header from '@site/src/components/Header';


      	•	Avoid @site in Markdown links—use absolute paths instead.

      	11.	Code Examples
      Provide clearly formatted code snippets suitable for copy-pasting.
      Maintain consistent syntax highlighting, indentation, and structure.
      	12.	Images
      Insert an image placeholder where needed. Include a brief description of
      the image below the placeholder. The final image element should follow
      this format (folder name may vary):


      <img src="/img/installing/installing-2.png" alt="VS Code's Install from
      VSIX dialog" width="600" />
